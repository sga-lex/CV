  <h3> Modules </h3>

    <p><i>Introduction to Programming</i> --> I became familiar with using a high-level programming language
such as Python to implement algorithms. Applying simple data structures within Python
programming, I can confidently test and run programmes, addressing numerous types of
problems within the software.</p>
    <p><i>Object Oriented Programming </i> --> I gained a deep understanding of object-oriented software
methodology, both in theory and practice. Throughout this module, I used Java programming
language to design and code iterators for collection based-data management.</p>
    <p><i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i> --> During this module I was introduced to basic data structures
and their associated algorithms. I am now confident in applying different algorithm design
principles, as well as being able to distinguish the differences between these principles.</p>
